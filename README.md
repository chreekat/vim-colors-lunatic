# The Lunatic Colorscheme

// Insert screen shot

***Don't like Solarized? Then you should probably just move along***

### What the Dingles?

This theme assumes you've done the Solarized bold-color hack on your terminal to
get 16 different colors in an 8-color palette. For gnome-terminal, you can use
the included `solarize` script^[1].

Next, this theme turns off a whole mess of colors.

### But but...

Syntax highlighting means different things to different people. I find much of
it unnecessary. This colorscheme is an experiment in minimizing the amount of
colors on the screen.

[1]: It munges the "Default" theme, which is hardcoded. If you know a way around
hardcoding that value, that would be sweet.
